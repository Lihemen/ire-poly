# IRE POLY FILES

The implementation of the Ire Polythenic is seperated by design into various folders. Each folder contains 2 files

1 The `index.html`

- These are implemented as is from the design with the exact dimensions. Suitable for print of wide preview

2 The `main.html`

- These are implemented in close approximation while maintaining the original aspect ratio. The files appear smaller and are suitable for showcase within an application e.g the Student Portal dashboard.
